## Firing up the app

To run the app use your CLI in the root of the project folder and install required npm modules
```
npm install
```

Once the modules have been installed, you must start the development server
```
npm start
```

Your browser should open once the server is up and running. If the browser does not start up automatically, fire it up yourself and navigate to http://localhost:3000/


## Troubleshooting

If there are errors when installing the modules, please make sure that you have the latest version of nodejs and npm.
